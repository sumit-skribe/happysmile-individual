  How can I create a hero section in Next.js that displays a heading, a paragraph, and an image side-by-side, where the heading and paragraph are dynamically generated by a large language model? The image, sourced from the Pexels API, has a fixed size to preserve the pageâ€™s aesthetic. What is the optimal approach to achieve this layout in Next.js?
